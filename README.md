### About the scripts
The scripts in this repositiory are used to analyze novel antibiotic resistance gene sequences predicted in sequence data. The contents of each subdirectory is explained below.

## blast_scripts
This directory contains scripts that can be used to BLAST predicted ARG sequences against a database of reference ARG sequences and idenitfy which sequences represent known ARGs based on sequence similarity.

## miscellaneous_scripts
This directory contains auxiliary Python scripts that can be used by themselves or as part of larger pipelines.

## phylogenetic_analysis
This directory contains scripts that can be used to create phylogenetic trees from predicted ARG sequences.

## taxonomic_analysis
This directory contains scripts that can be used to analyze the taxonomy of hosts of predicted ARGs.
